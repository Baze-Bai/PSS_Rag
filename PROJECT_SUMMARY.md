## 💡 Technical Innovations and Best Practices

### Advanced RAG Implementation
```python

    """Enhanced RAG with security, monitoring, and scalability"""
    
    def process_query(self, question: str) -> tuple:
        # Security validation before processing
        client_id = security_manager.get_client_ip()
        allowed, remaining = security_manager.check_rate_limit(client_id)
        
        if not allowed:
            return None, None, None
        
        # Semantic search with FAISS
        q_embedding = self.model.encode([question])
        q_embedding = np.array(q_embedding, dtype="float32")
        faiss.normalize_L2(q_embedding)
        
        # Vector similarity search
        D, I = self.index.search(q_embedding, Config.TOP_K_RESULTS)

            modelId=self.model_id,
            body=json.dumps(body)
        )
        return json.loads(response['body'].read())
    except ClientError as e:
        if e.response['Error']['Code'] in ['ThrottlingException']:
            logger.warning("Rate limiting detected, backing off...")
            raise  # Triggers retry
